An open-source Node.js library, textanalyser.js, harnesses artificial intelligence and conventional methods for text analysis. Even as Python dominates the AI and ML domains, we're enriching JavaScript's capabilities. Taking cues from TensorFlow's strides in JS, textanalyser.js steps it up. Integration is seamlessâ€”invoke a function, and get immediate results. Expertly crafted for peak performance, with a touch of heart. ðŸŒŸ

ðŸš€ **Latest Updates**: We have just launched! Stay tuned for more features.

## Installation

## Usage

### Sentiment Analysis

To conduct sentiment analysis, import the `getSentiment` function and pass your desired text as an argument.

```javascript
const getSentiment = require("textanalyser.js");

const runTest = async () => {
    const result = await getSentiment("Your text here");
    console.log(result);
};

console.time("Runtime");
runTest();
console.timeEnd("Runtime");
```

**Sample Output**:
```
Runtime: 22.955ms
{ emoji: 'ðŸ˜±', positivityValue: '3.457%' }
```
